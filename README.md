`CLove-Unit` is a single-header unit testing library designed for C (compatible with C++).

This library can automatically detect and execute your tests, providing comprehensive details about successes and failures, such as file, line number,
and reason for failure. Additionally, it offers a variety of output formats thanks to a powerful command-line API.

`CLove-Unit` allows you to focus solely on creating unit tests, eliminating the need to manually register tests or create custom assertions.

Here is an example of the default report format, which features pretty printing with ANSI support:

- **Tests Auto-discovery**: Simplify test writing with the `CLOVE_TEST` macro for automatic registration.
- **Test Report**: Report format in ANSI, CSV, or JSON. Customize format and output with command-line args.
- **Tests/Run Duration**: Measure and report test execution times.
- **Tests/Run Failure**: Get file, line, and failure info with the assertion macros.
- **Selective Test Execution**: Include or exclude tests for each run.
- **Command-line API**: Create IDE plugins and automate with versatile options.

## IDE Extensions

## Supported Package Managers

`CLove-Unit` is also available on the following Package Managers:

* [Conan](https://conan.io/center/recipes/clove-unit)

## How It Works

`CLove-Unit` is built upon these fundamental concepts:

- **Test:** A test is essentially a function that lets you stimulate your code and verify its behavior through assertions.
- **Suite:** A suite is a collection of tests is run. It enables you to define setup and teardown procedures for each test execution or for the
  entire suite.
- **Runner:** The runner facilitates the execution of multiple suites and offers result reporting.

> The test discovery in CLove-Unit works by parsing the symbol table inside the test executable.
>
> Currently, this feature is accessible for the following combinations of OS, architecture, and executable formats:
>
> - Windows / 32-64 bit little-endian / PE (Portable Executable)
> - MacOS / 64 bit little-endian / Mach-o (Mach Object)
> - Linux / 64 bit little-endian / ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)
>
> Additional compatibilities regarding OS, architecture, and formats can be implemented in the future as needed.

## Getting Started

Getting started with CLove-Unit is simple. Just follow these steps:

### 1. Include CLove-Unit

Include the [clove-unit.h](./clove-unit.h) header in your project.

### 2. Define a Suite

Before creating test cases, define a suite name. For example:

```c
//file test_suite1.c
#define CLOVE_SUITE_NAME MySuite01
#include "clove-unit.h"

CLOVE_TEST(FirstTest) {
    int a = 1;
    int b = 1;
    CLOVE_INT_EQ(a, b);
}

CLOVE_TEST(SecondTest) {
    CLOVE_IS_TRUE(1);
}
```

### 3. Set up the Runner

A Runner is the entry point of the program that enables the auto-discovery feature by defining `CLOVE_IMPLEMENTATION`
**once** before `clove-unit.h`. This will include the entire library implementation.

```c
//file main.c
#define CLOVE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "clove-unit.h"

CLOVE_RUNNER()
```

### 4. Build and Run

Build and run the test executable and `CLove-Unit` will do the magic :-)

> Look at the [CLove101](./examples/clove101) project for samples about:
> - Implementing suites and tests.
> - Assertion usage ([test_suite1.c](./examples/clove101/src/test_suite1.c))
> - Suite setup & tear down feature ([test_suite2.c](./examples/clove101/src/test_suite2.c))

### Test Helpers

Helper APIs to support test implementation.

| API                      | Description                                                |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CLOVE_EXEC_PATH()`      | Macro to easily retrieve executable path as a `char*`      |
| `CLOVE_EXEC_BASE_PATH()` | Macro to easily retrieve executable base path as a `char*` |

## Command-Line API

A binary built with the `CLove-Unit` library supports a number of command line options at startup:

> `<executable> [options]`

| Options                     | Description                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \<no-option\>               | Running executable with no args will execute tests <br />producing a report in `pretty` format (default)                          |
| `-e` `--exclude <expr>`     | Exclude tests is run/listed<br /> (can be repeated more than once)<br /> [[read here for more details](#test-inclusionexclusion)] |
| `-h` `--help`               | Display usage information.                                                                                                        |
| `-i` `--include <expr>`     | Include tests is run/listed<br /> (can be repeated more than once)<br /> [[read here for more details](#test-inclusionexclusion)] |
| `-l` `--list-tests`         | List all/matching test cases in `pretty` format (default).<br />Accepts inclusion/exclusion expression.                           |
| `-o` `--output <stream>`    | Specify output stream for a report. <br />Possible options: `stdout` (default) or `<file path>`                                   |
| `-r` `--report <format>`    | Specify report format when running/listing tests. <br />Possible options: `pretty` `csv` `json`                                   |
| `-t` `--run-tests`          | Execute all/matching test cases (same as \<no-option\> scenario).<br />Accepts inclusion/exclusion expression.                    |
| `-v` `--version`            | Show CLove-Unit version.                                                                                                          |
| `-x` `--error-on-test-fail` | Test run process will end with error in case of test failure. <br />Default is to end the process successfully.                   |

### Test Inclusion/Exclusion

Inclusion/Exclusion options are useful to collect a specific subset of Suites/Tests and can be repeated more than once on the command line.

> NOTE: If both inclusion and exclusion options are provided, the inclusion pattern always wins over the exclusion pattern.

These options allow you to specify an expression that works like this:

* **Basic:** `SuiteName.TestName`
* **Wildcard:** Only `*` is supported, and can be used to implement patterns such as "starts with", "ends with", "contains", "all", for both the
  SuiteName and TestName

For example, the following are valid selection patterns (non-exhaustive list):

| Pattern            | Description                                                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MySuite01.Test01` | Will match exactly the Suite Name and the Test Name.                             |
| `MySuite01`        | Will match all tests whose Suite Name is "MySuite01".                            |
| `Suite*`           | Will match all tests whose Suite Name starts with "Suite".                       |
| `*Suite01`         | Will match all tests whose Suite Name ends with "Suite01".                       |
| `*Suite*`          | Will match all tests whose Suite Name contains "Suite".                          |
| `*Suite*`          | Will match all tests whose Suite Name contains "Suite".                          |
| `MySuite01.*01`    | Will match all tests whose Suite Name is MySuite01 and Test Name ends with "01". |
| `*.*`              | Will match all suites and tests.                                                 |
